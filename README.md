# wordle-fr-pr√©nom

Fork of WordleFR and custom the game to find a name.

If you want to force a name, set it in .env
```
VUE_APP_NAME_TO_FIND="DIANE"
```

"Le Mot" also called "WordleFR" is a game, freely inspired by ["Wordle"](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) made by [Josh Wardle](https://twitter.com/powerlanguish).

The idea, the concept and the design were, for the most part, taken from the original project.

You can find Le Mot at this URL : [wordle.louan.me](https://wordle.louan.me)
